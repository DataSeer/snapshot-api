## Introduction

This document provides detailed information about the available endpoints in
the [Snapshot API](https://snapshot.dataseer.ai) (hosted on [snapshot.dataseer.ai](https://snapshot.dataseer.ai)).
The API expects to receive one PDF document for each request, along with, required parameters and an authentication
token, and it returns a JSON response with the computed OSI scores and other relevant information.

## Authentication

All endpoints require JWT authentication which are based on tokens provided by DataSeer.
The API tokens must be included in each requests `Authorization header`:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

Should you need an API token or have issues with authentication, please contact DataSeer support (support@dataseer.ai). Each API token is
bounded to a specific user.

| `/processPDF` | POST   | `multipart/form-data` | Process a PDF document                         |

### API Information (GET)

#### Example Request

Using curl:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" https://snapshot.dataseer.ai/
```

Using JavaScript (with fetch):

```javascript
fetch('https://snapshot.dataseer.ai/', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <your_token>'
    }
})
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "path": "/",
      "method": "GET",
      "description": "Get API information"
    },
    {
      "path": "/processPDF",
      "method": "POST",
      "description": "Process a PDF file"
    }
  ],

}
```

### Process PDF (POST)

#### Request Parameters

| Field   | Type   | Description                                                                                             |
|---------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| file    | File   | The PDF file to be processed (required)                                                                 |
| options | String | **JSON string** of processing options (required) which is a dictionary with optional and required items |

The `options` parameter must contain one mandatory field:

- `document_type` (required): specify the type of the document sent (see example below), the accepted values are
  `article`, `research-article`, `research_article`, `original-article`, `original_article`. Invalid values will be
  rejected by the API with error code 400.
- `article_id` (required): specify the article ID of the document sent, the API will return 400 if the ID is empty or
  null

```json
{
     "article_id": "KWG1234",
     "document_type": "article"
}
```

#### Example Request

Using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" \
     -F "file=@path/to/your/file.pdf" \
     -F 'options={"article_id": "KWG1234", "document_type": "article"}' \
     https://snapshot.dataseer.ai/processPDF
```

Using JavaScript (with fetch):

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', fileInput.files[0]);
formData.append('options', JSON.stringify({
    // options data
}));

fetch('https://snapshot.dataseer.ai/processPDF', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer <your_token>'
    },
    body: formData
})
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

#### Example Response

Here is an example of JSON data returned by the API.
The ‘response’ key is an array of objects. Each item is structured as follows:
  - `name`: the name of the data (ex: das, non-functional_urls, cumulated_score)
  - `description`: the description of the data (ex: "Data availability statement" for "das")
  - `value`: the value of the data

***Note: the value of `cumulated_score` is between -10 and 32***

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests.
